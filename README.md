# springboot-rest-server
This is a Spring Boot project which can create update delete find read data from database. I have used JPARepository to interact with JDBC. 
Using this client can interact with this application to fetch the data and insert update the data.
It is a simple SpringBoot Based CRUD APPLICATION.
